# 1.0 - The Roblox Hierachy

In Roblox Studio, understanding of the hierachy is crucial to game development. Without further delay, here
are some key concepts of the Roblox hierachy.
<br>
Think of the hierachy as one huge family.

<br>

First off, you have the original person who has a child. This is the *Parent*.
<br>

When the child has a child, the original parent now has a grandchild. In Roblox Studio, we call this a *Descendant*.
If that grandchild has a child, then that new child will still be classified as a *Descendant* of the original parent.

<br>

To the grandchild, the original parent is what we call an *Ancestor*.
The grandchild's child also will see the original parent as an *Ancestor*.

<br>

If the original parent has more than one child, then their children will be siblings to eachother.
In Roblox Studio, this is exactly what it sounds like, the two children are *Siblings*.

<br>

Now, not to forget, if someone's child has a child, that child can also be be known as a *Parent*.

<br>

- Parents: Parents contain *Children*. While containing children, *Parents* can still be children to other *Objects*.
- Children: Children contain other *Children*
- Siblings: While not exactly part of the hierachy, *Siblings*, are *Children* and are found next to another child of the same parent.
- Descendants: Descendants are the *Children* of *Children* of a *Parent*, anything parented to a descendant is also a descendant of the original *Parent*.
- Ancestors: Ancestors are the *Parents* of *Parents* of a *Child*.

<br>

Here is a small example hierachy of what your game might look like:

- game (Parent + Ancestor of all *Objects*): <br>
    - Workspace (Parent + Child + Ancestor of Texture and Decal) <br>
        - Baseplate (Child + Sibling + Descendant of game) <br>
            - Texture (Child + Descendant of game and Workspace) <br>
        - SpawnLocation (Child + Sibling + Descendant of game) <br>
            - Decal (Child + Descendant of game and Workspace)

game: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workspace: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baseplate: <br>

game (Parent + Ancestor): <br>
----> Workspace (Parent + Child + Ancestor) <br>
--------> Baseplate (Parent + Child + Descendant) <br>
------------> Texture (Child + Descendant) <br>
--------> SpawnLocation (Parent + Child + Descendant) <br>
------------> Decal (Child + Descendant) <br>

And that concludes the basics of the Roblox hierachy! This is needed to understand lots of aspects of your game.
