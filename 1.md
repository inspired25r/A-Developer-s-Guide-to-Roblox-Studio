## The Roblox Hierachy

In Roblox Studio, understanding of the hierachy is crucial to game development. Without further delay, here
are some key concepts of the Roblox hierachy.
<br>

- Parents: Parents contain *Children*. While containing children, *Parents* can still be children to other *Objects*.
- Children: Children contain other *Children*
- Siblings: While not exactly part of the hierachy, *Siblings*
- Descendents
- Ancestors

<br>

Here is a small example hierachy of what your game might look like:

- game (Parent + Ancestor of all *Objects*): <br>
    - Workspace (Parent + Child + Ancestor of Texture and Decal) <br>
        - Baseplate (Child + Sibling + Descendant of game) <br>
            - Texture (Child + Descendent of game and Workspace) <br>
        SpawnLocation (Child + Sibling + Descendant of game) <br>
            - Decal (Child + Descendent of game and Workspace)
